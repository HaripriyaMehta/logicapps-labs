# Module 03 - Parallelization Pattern

> **Pattern Complexity**: Medium  
> **Prerequisites**: Complete the handoff module

## Introduction

The parallelization pattern runs multiple agents simultaneously to improve speed or gather diverse perspectives. This pattern has two main variations: sectioning (breaking tasks into independent parallel subtasks) and voting (running the same task multiple times for diverse outputs).

## When to Use This Pattern

Use parallelization when:
- Subtasks can be processed independently for speed
- Multiple perspectives improve confidence in results
- Different aspects of a task need focused attention
- You need consensus-based decision making

## Pattern Variations

### Sectioning
Breaking tasks into independent parallel subtasks that can run simultaneously.

**Examples**:
- Content moderation (content check + policy violation screening)
- Code review (security + performance + style checks)
- Document analysis (structure + content + compliance)

### Voting
Running the same task multiple times with different approaches for diverse outputs.

**Examples**:
- Vulnerability assessment with consensus
- Content appropriateness evaluation
- Quality assurance with multiple reviewers

## Pattern Benefits

- **Speed**: Simultaneous execution reduces overall processing time
- **Focused Attention**: Each agent concentrates on specific aspects
- **Confidence**: Multiple perspectives increase result reliability
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failure of one agent doesn't block others

## Logic Apps Implementation

In this module, you'll learn to:
1. Design parallel agent architectures
2. Implement sectioning strategies
3. Build voting mechanisms with consensus logic
4. Aggregate results from parallel agents
5. Handle partial failures and timeouts

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Sectioning
Build a parallel document analysis system.

### Exercise 2: Voting Implementation
Create a multi-agent content evaluation system.

### Exercise 3: Result Aggregation
Implement sophisticated result combination logic.

### Exercise 4: Performance Optimization
Optimize parallel execution and handle edge cases.

## Key Concepts

- **Sectioning**: Independent parallel subtasks
- **Voting**: Multiple attempts for consensus
- **Aggregation**: Combining parallel results
- **Timeout Handling**: Managing slow or failed agents
