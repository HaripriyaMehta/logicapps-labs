# Module 02 - Prompt Chaining Pattern

> **Pattern Complexity**: Low  
> **Prerequisites**: Complete the overview module and basic conversational agent labs

## Introduction

The prompt chaining pattern decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each agent call processes the output of the previous one. This pattern trades latency for higher accuracy by making each individual step an easier, more focused task.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use prompt chaining when:
- Tasks can be cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks
- Each step benefits from focused attention
- Quality is more important than speed
- You need validation gates between steps

## Pattern Benefits

- **Higher Accuracy**: Each agent focuses on a single, well-defined task
- **Validation Gates**: Programmatic checks can be added between steps
- **Debugging**: Easy to identify where issues occur in the chain
- **Modularity**: Individual steps can be optimized independently

## Common Examples

- **Content Creation**: Outline → Draft → Edit → Format
- **Data Processing**: Extract → Validate → Transform → Load
- **Translation**: Source text → Intermediate analysis → Target language → Quality check

## Logic Apps Implementation

In this module, you'll learn to:
1. Design effective prompt chains
2. Implement sequential agent calls
3. Add validation gates between steps
4. Handle errors and recovery
5. Monitor chain execution
