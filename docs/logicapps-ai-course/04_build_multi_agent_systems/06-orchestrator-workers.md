# Module 05 - Orchestrator-Workers Pattern

> **Pattern Complexity**: High  
> **Prerequisites**: Complete the evaluator-optimizer module

## Introduction

The orchestrator-workers pattern implements dynamic task decomposition where a central orchestrator agent breaks down complex tasks, delegates them to specialized worker agents, and synthesizes their results. This pattern is ideal when subtasks cannot be predicted in advance and must be determined dynamically based on the input.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use orchestrator-workers when:
- Subtasks cannot be predefined and must be determined dynamically
- Complex tasks require different types of expertise
- The scope and nature of work varies significantly by input
- You need flexible, adaptive task decomposition
- Results from multiple workers must be synthesized intelligently

## Pattern Components

### Orchestrator Agent
- Analyzes complex tasks and breaks them down
- Determines which workers to engage and in what sequence
- Coordinates worker activities and dependencies
- Synthesizes results into coherent outputs

### Worker Agents
- Specialized agents with specific expertise areas
- Execute focused subtasks assigned by the orchestrator
- Report results back to the orchestrator
- May communicate with other workers when needed

### Task Decomposition Logic
- Dynamic analysis of task requirements
- Worker selection and assignment algorithms
- Dependency management and scheduling

## Common Examples

- **Complex Coding Tasks**: Analyze requirements → File modifications → Testing → Integration
- **Research Projects**: Topic analysis → Source identification → Information gathering → Synthesis
- **Business Analysis**: Problem definition → Data gathering → Analysis → Recommendations
- **Content Creation**: Research → Writing → Editing → Formatting → Review

## Key Differences from Parallelization

- **Dynamic**: Subtasks determined at runtime, not predefined
- **Flexible**: Can adapt to different types of inputs
- **Hierarchical**: Clear orchestrator-worker relationship
- **Synthesized**: Results are combined intelligently, not just aggregated

## Logic Apps Implementation

In this module, you'll learn to:
1. Design orchestrator decision-making logic
2. Create specialized worker agent interfaces
3. Implement dynamic task decomposition
4. Handle worker coordination and dependencies
5. Synthesize results from multiple workers

## Lab Exercises
