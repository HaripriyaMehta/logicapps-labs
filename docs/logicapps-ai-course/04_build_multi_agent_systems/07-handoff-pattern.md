# Module 07 - Handoff Pattern

> **Pattern Complexity**: Medium  
> **Prerequisites**: Complete the routing module

## Introduction

The handoff pattern enables seamless transitions between agents with different specializations while maintaining conversation continuity and context. This pattern is essential for scenarios requiring human-like escalation or expertise transfer.

## When to Use This Pattern

Use handoff when:
- You need to transfer control between specialized agents
- Context and conversation state must be preserved
- Different stages of a process require different expertise
- Human-like escalation patterns are beneficial

## Pattern Benefits

- **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on its area of expertise
- **Context Preservation**: Seamless state transfer between agents
- **Natural Escalation**: Mimics human customer service patterns
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one agent don't affect others

## Common Examples

- **Customer Service**: General support → Technical specialist → Billing expert
- **Content Creation**: Research agent → Writing agent → Editing agent
- **Problem Solving**: Analysis agent → Solution design agent → Implementation agent
- **Sales Process**: Lead qualification → Product specialist → Closing agent

## Logic Apps Implementation

In this module, you'll learn to:
1. Design handoff triggers and criteria
2. Implement context preservation mechanisms
3. Set up initialization actions for receiving agents
4. Handle handoff failures and recovery
5. Monitor multi-agent handoff workflows

## Lab Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Agent Handoff
Build a simple two-agent handoff system.

### Exercise 2: Context Preservation
Implement comprehensive state transfer between agents.

### Exercise 3: Multi-Level Handoff
Create a chain of specialized agent handoffs.

### Exercise 4: Monitoring and Debugging
Track handoff performance and debug issues.

## Key Concepts

- **Handoff Triggers**: Conditions that initiate agent transitions
- **Context Transfer**: Mechanisms for preserving conversation state
- **Initialization Actions**: Preparing the receiving agent
- **Handoff Validation**: Ensuring successful transitions
