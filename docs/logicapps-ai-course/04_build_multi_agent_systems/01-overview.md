# Module 01 - Building Multi-Agent Systems with Logic Apps

> **Prerequisites**: This module builds upon concepts from the conversational agent and autonomous agent labs. You are encouraged to complete those modules before proceeding.

## Introduction

As AI agents become more sophisticated, the complexity of tasks they're asked to handle often exceeds what a single agent can efficiently manage. While a monolithic agent might theoretically handle complex scenarios, **multi-agent systems offer significant advantages in terms of reliability, maintainability, specialization, and scalability**.

### Why Multi-Agent Systems Matter

Single agents face several inherent limitations:

- **Cognitive Load**: Complex tasks require the agent to juggle multiple concerns simultaneously, leading to decreased performance on individual aspects
- **Error Propagation**: A single error can derail the entire process with no recovery mechanism
- **Lack of Specialization**: One agent cannot be optimized for all types of tasks equally well
- **Scalability Constraints**: Adding new capabilities to a monolithic agent increases complexity exponentially

Multi-agent architectures address these challenges by **decomposing complex problems into specialized, manageable components**. As noted by Anthropic in their research on building effective agents, "the most successful implementations use simple, composable patterns rather than complex frameworks" <sup>1</sup>. This principle of simplicity and composability is at the heart of effective multi-agent design.

### Key Benefits of Multi-Agent Systems

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent can focus on its specific expertise area
2. **Fault Isolation**: Errors in one agent don't necessarily cascade to others
3. **Independent Optimization**: Each agent can be tuned for its specific task
4. **Reusability**: Specialized agents can be reused across different workflows
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Natural checkpoints for human review and intervention
6. **Scalable Development**: Teams can work on different agents independently

## Multi-Agent Patterns Overview

Logic Apps provides native support for several proven multi-agent orchestration patterns, ranging from simple compositional workflows to complex autonomous systems. Understanding when and how to apply each pattern is crucial for building effective systems. These patterns are ordered from least to most complexity:

### 1. Prompt Chaining Pattern

**Complexity Level**: Low  
**When to use**: When tasks can be cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks that follow a linear sequence.

Prompt chaining "decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one" <sup>1</sup>. In Logic Apps, this translates to chaining multiple agents where each agent's output becomes the input for the next.

**Examples**:
- Marketing copy generation → translation to different language
- Document outline creation → outline validation → full document writing
- Data extraction → data validation → data formatting

**Key characteristics**:
- Linear progression through predetermined steps
- Each step can include programmatic validation ("gates")
- Higher accuracy through task decomposition
- Trade-off of latency for improved results

### 2. Routing Pattern

**Complexity Level**: Low-Medium  
**When to use**: When you have distinct categories of inputs that require different specialized handling.

The routing pattern "classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task" <sup>1</sup>. This enables separation of concerns and allows for specialized prompts optimized for specific input types.

**Examples**:
- Customer service queries (billing → billing agent, technical → support agent)
- Content classification (urgent → priority workflow, routine → standard workflow)
- Model selection (simple questions → lightweight agent, complex → advanced agent)

**Key characteristics**:
- Initial classification step determines routing
- Specialized agents for different categories
- Prevents optimization conflicts between different input types
- Can use traditional classification algorithms or LLM-based routing

### 3. Parallelization Pattern

**Complexity Level**: Medium  
**When to use**: When subtasks can be processed independently for speed, or when multiple perspectives improve confidence.

This pattern has two main variations as described by Anthropic <sup>1</sup>:
- **Sectioning**: Breaking tasks into independent parallel subtasks
- **Voting**: Running the same task multiple times for diverse outputs

**Examples**:
- **Sectioning**: Content moderation (one agent checks content, another screens for policy violations)
- **Sectioning**: Code review (different agents check security, performance, style)
- **Voting**: Multiple agents evaluate content appropriateness with different thresholds
- **Voting**: Vulnerability assessment with consensus-based decision making

**Key characteristics**:
- Simultaneous execution for improved speed
- Results aggregated programmatically
- Better performance through focused attention on specific aspects

### 4. Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern

**Complexity Level**: High  
**When to use**: When you have clear evaluation criteria and iterative refinement provides measurable value.

In this pattern, "one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop" <sup>1</sup>. This mimics human iterative improvement processes.

**Examples**:
- Literary translation with nuance evaluation and refinement
- Complex search tasks requiring multiple rounds of analysis
- Content creation with quality assessment and improvement cycles

**Key characteristics**:
- Iterative refinement loops
- Clear evaluation criteria required
- Generator and evaluator agent roles
- Termination conditions to prevent infinite loops

### 5. Orchestrator-Workers Pattern (Nested Agents as Tools)

**Complexity Level**: High  
**When to use**: When you can't predict required subtasks in advance and need dynamic task decomposition.

This pattern treats agents as sophisticated tools that can be invoked by other agents. "A central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results" <sup>1</sup>.

**Examples**:
- Coding tasks requiring changes to unpredictable numbers of files
- Research tasks gathering information from multiple dynamic sources
- Complex analysis requiring different specialized capabilities

**Key differences from parallelization**:
- Subtasks are determined dynamically by the orchestrator
- More flexible but also more unpredictable
- Requires sophisticated coordination logic


### 6. Handoff Pattern

**Complexity Level**: Medium  
**When to use**: When you need to transfer control between agents with different specializations while maintaining conversation continuity.

The handoff pattern enables **seamless transitions between agents** while preserving context and state. This pattern is particularly effective for scenarios requiring human-like escalation or expertise transfer.

**Examples**:
- Customer service scenarios (general support → technical specialist → billing)
- Content creation workflows (research → writing → editing)
- Complex problem-solving (analysis → solution design → implementation)

**Key considerations**:
- Clear handoff criteria and triggers
- State preservation between agents
- Proper context transfer mechanisms
- Initialization actions to prepare the receiving agent

## Logic Apps Advantages for Multi-Agent Systems

Logic Apps provides several unique advantages for implementing multi-agent systems:

1. **Visual Design**: Clear representation of agent interactions and decision points
2. **Built-in State Management**: Native support for maintaining context across agent calls
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
4. **Monitoring and Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of multi-agent workflows
5. **Integration Capabilities**: Easy integration with external systems and services
6. **Scalability**: Auto-scaling and enterprise-grade reliability

## Course Structure

This module is organized into hands-on labs that teach you to build the most practical multi-agent patterns using Logic Apps. While we've covered six different patterns above, there are many variants that can be built using the foundations from the above patterns:

Each lab demonstrates practical implementations with real-world examples, showing how these foundational patterns can be combined and customized to create more complex multi-agent systems. By mastering these core patterns, you'll have the building blocks to implement any of the eight patterns described above.
